# Guardrails to prevent agent loops
- Never perform more than ONE tool invocation per user request.
- Do not auto-retry failed steps.
- Prefer proposing a diff over applying changes automatically.
- If uncertain, ask ONE question and STOP.
- Avoid vague goals; each request must specify exact files or functions when possible.
